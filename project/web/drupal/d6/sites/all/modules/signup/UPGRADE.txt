======================================================================
This file contains specific instructions for upgrading your site's
version of signup.module to a new release.  You should always check
this file when you download a new version to see if there are any
specific things you need to know about a certain upgrade.
======================================================================


* Upgrading to 5.x-2.3 (from any earlier version)

  The 5.x-2.3 release improves support for the views.module, by moving
all of the hard-coded parts of the signup interface that can be
implemented with views into a separate file (signup_no_views.inc).
This file is only included if the views.module is not enabled on your
site.  Now, you have full control to modify the "Current signups"
block and the listing of current signups at user/[#]/signups using the
views administrative user interface (admin/build/views).

  However, this means that if your site had the old "List of users
current signups" block enabled, and you have the views.module
installed (or install it at any point when running signup 5.x-2.3 or
later), you will have to manually enable the "Current signups" block
(which might also have the name "signup_current_signups") by visiting
the admin/build/block page on your site.

  NOTE: the default views that are defined by signup_views.inc work
best with at least views version 5.x-1.6 or later.
