It is assumed that you have Drupal up and running.  Be sure to check
the http://drupal.org web site if you need assistance.  If you run
into problems, you should always read the INSTALL.txt that comes with
the Drupal package and read the online documentation.


0. Always backup your database before you enable a new contributed module!


1. Place the signup package into your Drupal modules/ directory.


2. (Optional) Customize the form presented to users when signing up
   for content on your site.  Unfortuantely, there is not yet a way to
   do this from within your site, you must modify a theme function to
   change this form.  See the comment above "theme_signup_user_form()"
   in the signup.theme file.  You can either modify that version of
   the function, or define your own version in your site's theme.


3. Enable the signup module by navigating to:
   Administer > Site building > Modules

   Note: if you want support for automatic closing of events and
   reminder emails you must also install and enable the event package!

   Click the 'Save configuration' button at the bottom to commit your
   changes.


4. For the final configuration of the module, navigate to:
   Administer > Site configuration > Signup

   Here you can configure the options for the module.


5. Enable the node types that you wish to allow signups for under:
   Administer > Content management > Content types

   You may wish to create a new content type specifically for event
   signups (which you can customize via the Content Construction Kit
   from http://drupal.org/project/cck), or install the Event module
   (http://drupal.org/project/event).


6. Grant the proper access to user accounts under:
   Administer > User management > Access control

   'sign up for content':
     Allows users to sign up for any content types that are signup-enabled.
     NOTE: Enabling 'sign up for content' for the anonymous user will
     allow anonymous users to sign up by entering an email address.

   'cancel own signups':
     Allows users to cancel their own signups. Without this permission,
     only users with 'administer all signups' or 'administer signups for
     own content' permission are allowed to cancel signups.
     NOTE: Anonymous users aren't allowed cancel their signups even if
     this permission is granted to the role 'anonymous user'.

   'view all signups':
     Allows users to view all of the users who have signed up for any
     signup-enabled content on the site.

   'email all signed up users':
     Allows users to send an email to everyone who has signed up for
     any signup-enabled content on the site.

   'email users signed up for own content':
     Allows a user to send an email to everyone who has signed up for
     content owned by the user.

   'admininister all signups':
     Implies 'view all signups' and 'cancel own signups' permissions.
     Allows users to view who has signed up for nodes, to cancel
     signups of other users, to close signups for specific nodes, and
     to configure system-wide settings related to this module.

   'administer signups for own content':
     Allows users to view who has signed up, to cancel signups of
     other users, and to close signups for any nodes that the user owns.

   Viewing the signup report (Administer > Content management > Signup),
   and configuring the module (Administer > Site configuration > Signup)
   are restricted to users who have the 'access administration pages'
   privilege.


7. (Optional) If you have enabled the views module on your site
   (http://drupal.org/project/views), be sure you are running views
   version 5.x-1.6 or later.  Once you have everything installed and
   working, you should consider customizing any of the signup-related
   views to better suit the needs of your site.  For example, if you
   are using the event module, you might want to add a filter to the
   'current signups' view to restrict it to events that have not
   started yet.


8. Start signing up!
